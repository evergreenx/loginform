# Login Form SPA

A polished, accessible single-page application featuring a modern email/password login form built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Design & UX
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface with gradient background and card-based layout
- **Responsive**: Fully responsive design that works on all device sizes
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during form submission with spinner animation
- **Field Disabling**: All form fields are automatically disabled during loading to prevent multiple submissions
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: Users can show/hide password with accessible button

### â™¿ Accessibility
- **WCAG Compliant**: Meets accessibility standards with proper contrast ratios
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard support with logical tab order
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus on email field and error handling focus
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper form structure with labels and error associations

### âœ… Form Validation
- **Real-time Validation**: Instant feedback as users type and on field blur
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format checking with regex
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 character validation
- **Error States**: Clear error messages with visual indicators
- **Field State Management**: Tracks touched fields to show relevant validation

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interfaces for form data and errors
- **React Hooks**: Modern React patterns with useState, useRef, and useEffect
- **Mock Authentication**: Simulated server interaction with realistic delays
- **Form State Management**: Comprehensive handling of form data, errors, and loading states
- **Field Disabling Strategy**: Uses `isLoading` state to disable all interactive elements during submission

## Form Field Disabling

The application implements a robust field disabling strategy during form submission:

\`\`\`typescript
// All form inputs are disabled when isLoading is true
<field
  disabled={isLoading}
/>

\`\`\`

This prevents:
- Multiple form submissions
- User input during processing
- Accidental navigation away from the form
- Race conditions in form handling
